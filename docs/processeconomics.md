In our economics analysis, we considered the costs of RNA nucleotides, Cas 13a, Reporter ssRNA and PDMS inputs. A detailed calculation is presented in the appendix. We determined that there needs to be 118,125 tests produced per week to satisfy the requirement to test 45,000 JHU community members twice per week and have tests on standby in case of manufacturing/delivering errors or extra tests needed. An outline of the cost breakdown for production cost of  1 test and a weekâ€™s (118,125) tests are in the table below. 

| Materials    | Cost($) per 1 Test | Total Cost ($) per week |
| :---        |    :----:   |    :----:   |
| PDMS | $22.87 | $2,701,584 |
| Cas 13a | $4.13 \* 10<sup>-7</sup> | $0.048837 |
| Reporter ssRNA | $1.4\*10<sup>-8</sup>  | $0.0017 |
| RNA Nucleotides | $0.00136 | $160.10 |
| **Total** | ~$22.871 | ~$2,701,679.45 |
