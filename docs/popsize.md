As part of an initial study into the dynamics of the efficacy and endurance of our testing, we have chosen the Johns Hopkins University student and faculty body, along with subsidiaries of the same to be part of our sample size. Constrained within the geographical limits of the city of Baltimore, the approximate target size for our initial tier of testing will be 45,000 individuals, including but not limited to the undergraduate.graduate students, student employees and members of the Hopkins Medicine team/front line workers. We will have a non-bound limit on the number of tests and vaccination procedures we will administer, simply owing to the ever-rising and undulating nature of the current pandemic. This will allow us to have a real-time scaling of the number of tests, given it exceeds our initial expectations of the aforementioned figure. Within this figure, some members of the direct Hopkins community may be excluded, such as people with preexisting medical conditions that interfere with our processes, or individuals with high to-and-fro movement within our set geographical constraints.
Our rationale for testing within this specific group is the direct access to unaltered/unbiased data, with a home-base advantage to allow access to local data hosting and data science operations.
