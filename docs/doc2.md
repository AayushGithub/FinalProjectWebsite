The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected the globe greatly due to its ability to easily spread easily among people. The lack of effective testing and subsequent contact tracing has led to the closure of many public spaces such as schools, shops, and restaurants. Quick and efficient COVID-19 tests are vital to contain the spread and allow for safe and gradual reopenings. Universities are important for high level education and for fostering thinking. The shifting of many universities to a completely online experience is only a temporary solution. Here, we have come up with a COVID-19 test using CRISPR technology to detect presence of COVID-19 in the patient’s DNA sample. This rapid test uses the patient’s saliva to analyze the signal produced by CRISPR in determining positive or negative results. We are applying this test to the Johns Hopkins Undergraduate Community (population: 3,000) with enough capacity to not only test every undergraduate every 3 days and account for any additional testing needed for false positives and infections.
