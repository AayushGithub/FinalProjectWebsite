The significance of this process is that we have developed an effective testing method to adequately keep our Johns Hopkins community safe while striving to be environmentally conscious and cost effective. We have concluded that testing individuals at least 2-3 times a week would be ideal to reach our target of ensuring that each person is tested once every three days, because the CDC cites research stating it takes 2-14 days for a test to give an accurate positive reading based on the virusâ€™ incubation period, so we deemed that one test every 3 days would be ideal for our community. 

With **$2,701,679.45**, we can produce 2-3 testing receptacles per community member per week for our community of **45,000**. We also want to ensure we have room for possible errors in manufacturing/distribution or unexpected outbreaks, hence, we will produce 5% more supply than the theoretical total needed, and this cost is reflected in the total cost. The cost of this 5% supply addition can also be justified by situational cases where more testing may be needed, for example: if someone is believed to have falsely tested negative because they still exhibit symptoms and live with other infected students, we would like to double test them to have confidence in the results.
