Our test production system is effective in testing for SARS-COV-2 in just 120 minutes. The test requires saliva and is easy to use by a medical professional. With some costs of the individual components being scaled up (and high to begin with), our endeavour to make this testing methodology and technique widespread is expensive. The monetary costs may not match up to the output and utility that our test is providing as a result. We can consider more cost effective options, such as the costs for the PDMS casing, or the price per unit for our biomolecules. If the prices of the materials are constant and changes are simply not feasible, reusable tests and lowered disposal rates can be considered. The easiest method to lower costs drastically is the reuse of test receptacles, which decreases the production of PDMS casing. A system dedicated to cleaning and recycling PDMS receptacles needs to be investigated to further increase the efficiency of the testing procedure and lower cost.
