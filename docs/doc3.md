We analyzed the detection of COVID-19 levels in patients based on this paper. The patient’s saliva sample, with the possibility of containing SARS-COV-2 RNA, is added with RNP2 and RNP4, creating the HEPN domain by the following reaction. 

Reaction 4:: RNA + RNP2 + RNP4 → RNA(RNP2)(RNP4)(HEPN)2 

Then, the reporter molecules are added and, upon being cleaved, produce signals that can be measured by the following reaction. 

Reaction 5: RNP2 + RNP4 + reporter → RNP2 + RNP4 + a S

A thing to note is the possibility of a false positive as a result of the ability for RNPs to cleave the reporter molecule with the following reaction, creating the same type of signaling. 

Reaction 6:RNA(RNP2)(RNP4)(HEPN)2+reporter → RNA(RNP2)(RNP4)(HEPN)2 +b S

The signal, measured in AU/min, is able to be detected over a period of 120 mins. The signals are detected by a mobile phone system using direction detection assay.  Its intensity and amount, as indicated by the slope, is used to determine the result. A minimum of around 1.35 \* 10<sup>3</sup> copies per uL of RNA to conclusively determine a positive result. In analyzing the system, 50nM of RNP2 and 50nM of RNP4 was reacted with 1.35 \* 10<sup>3</sup>copies per uL of RNA as the limiting reactant in reaction 4. Reaction 4 occurs over the span of 5 minutes. 

Extent of Rate of Reaction 4: 1.35 \* 10<sup>3</sup> copies of RNAuL \* 15min = 4.48 \* 10<sup>-7</sup>nMmin 

Rates of reaction 5 and reaction 6 depend on the concentration of reporter molecules reacted. Both reactions occur over a 120 minute period. 

Extent of Rate of Reaction 5: 400nM reporter\*1120 min = 3.33nMmin

Extent of Rate of Reaction 6: 400nM reporter\*1120 min = 3.33nMmin

Reaction 5 and reaction 6 both produces S in AU/min and for 1.35\*10<sup>3</sup>copies per uL of RNA, the intensity is at 18 AU/min. Therefore, for any signaling intensity above 18AU/min, a positive test can be conclusively determined.
