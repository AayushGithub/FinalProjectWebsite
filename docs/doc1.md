The significance of this process is that we have developed an effective testing method to adequately keep our Johns Hopkins Homewood community safe while also being environmentally conscious and cost effective. We have concluded that testing individuals at least 2-3 times a week would be ideal to reach our target of ensuring that each person is tested once every three days--because the CDC cites research stating it takes 2-14 days for a test to give an accurate positive reading based on the virus’ incubation period, so we deemed that one test every 3 days would be ideal for our community. 

With ___ amount of money, we can produce 2-3 testing receptacles per community member per week since our community includes __ students and ___ faculty present on the Homewood campus. We also want to ensure we have room for possible errors in manufacturing/distribution or unexpected outbreaks, hence, we will produce 5% more supply than the theoretical total needed for an added cost of ____ more.

The cost of this 5% supply addition can also be justified by situational cases where more testing may be needed, for example: if someone is believed to have falsely tested negative because they still exhibit symptoms and live with other infected students, we would like to double test them in the case to have confidence of the first test’s results.
