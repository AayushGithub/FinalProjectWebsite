Since our sample well must have dimensions 2mm x 2mm x 10mm (40(mu) L), the thickness of the walls will be 1.2 mm on each side. Our team of combined expertise knowledge decided that 1.2mm was the most optimal wall thickness to ensure that we are minimizing our plastic usage while also maintaining a design that is not too flimsy to safely hold the sample and minimize possible damages to the receptacle. We tested this by referencing our prior experiences in lab where we dropped materials and thought about how often our equipment broke based on how well it was manufactured.
