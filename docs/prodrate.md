title: What is your target production rate?
sidebar_label: Target Production Rate

Depends on the output from our calculations, but we can aim to have two models. One would be a small batch creation of the tests with rigorous testing and failsafes to ensure a near perfect utilization of all raw materials with waste minimized and output maximized, and the other would be our version at scale, with an emphasis on the production rate rather than side products. The advantage lies in the quickest go-to-market approach given the time sensitive nature of our product.
We could launch a cost-production analysis to find the ‘sweet spot’ for the point where production is maximised and the cost influx is minimal. My recommendation is to just find a bunch of points where cost and net output is calculated and plot, and the regression of all of these just gives us our variance from median values.
Basically what this will tell us is that given a population that we want to test the production value. Say we have a test group where cost is not a factor, eg. testing amongst frontline workers to have absolute, immediate and regular testing. We can see from the regression that if we push more money in, does our output actually increase or is the effect so minimal that the cost is not justified.
